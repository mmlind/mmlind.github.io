      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 5 years that I setup this blog on GitHub Pages. Technology has moved on and there are a few new interesting options available.
I ended up choosing Hugo because it works well with GitHub Pages, renders static websites at a great performance, offers lots of templates to choose from, and was relatively simple to setup. Its customization though was a bit tricker than I hoped.
The Clarity theme includes a convenient switching between light- and dark-mode (at the top-right of the page), plus the ability to add topic tags which is a useful feature.</description>

      <description>Finally! I launched my new blog about my hacking adventures in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Following a recommendation on Andrej Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s blog I decided to use Jekyll and host it on Github.
Thanks to Barry Clark&amp;rsquo;s post it took only a few minutes to setup.
